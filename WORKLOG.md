## 2026-10-31 — Japanese farmhouse
Agent: Claude Code (claude-opus-5-5) · Commit: this commit
- Done: the house follows ROADMAP "Mood and tone" now: dark charred-board skirting, white
  plaster between dark timber posts and beams, a grey-blue kawara tile roof (rows of
  rounded tiles running down the slope) with a heavy ridge cap and raised ends, an engawa
  plank veranda along the front under the eaves (walls moved back to z 3.6 inside the
  same footprint, so collision is unchanged), two eave posts, a step stone, a shoji sliding
  door over the door cell and shoji windows. The western chimney, board wall, shingle
  roof, plank door and glass window surfaces were removed. The eave ends at about z 4.05,
  1.45 high, so it stays above the farmer on the cell in front of the door.
- Checked: `test_farm: OK (0 failed)` (the building-surface check now lists the new
  surfaces); headless `--quit-after 300` printed no errors or warnings; Movie Maker frame
  with `--demo` shows the new house with the farmer in front of the engawa.
- Left / next: fence, seed-stand awning and bin are still western (listed in ROADMAP).

## 2026-10-31 — Mood and tone: Japanese countryside
Agent: Claude Code (claude-opus-5-5) · Commit: this commit
- Done: at the user's request, ROADMAP got a "Mood and tone" section: the game should feel
  like rural Japan (satoyama village, Japanese buildings, nature, festivals, food, music
  and UI), with our own designs. The current western-style house and fence should move
  that way when next touched.
- Checked: docs only.
- Left / next: ROADMAP → Next up (rain / snow particles and weather tint).

## 2026-10-31 — Textured house, shipping bin, seed stand and fence
Agent: Claude Code (claude-opus-5-5) · Commit: this commit
- Done: the user said the farmer still looks a bit odd but asked to set it aside and move
  on (noted in ROADMAP). PlaceholderArt draws building surfaces (`build:<kind>`): board
  walls, shingle roof, stone, light / dark planks, a striped awning (16 x 16 = 1 unit,
  repeated with mesh-space triplanar mapping), a door (16 x 24) and a window (12 x 10). The
  house is walls + a wall-textured gable prism + two shingled roof slabs with overhang, a
  stone chimney, the door over the door cell and windows on the +z / +x faces the camera
  sees. The bin is a dark crate with a lid and a band; the stand has a counter, posts, a
  tilted striped awning and three seed sacks. The fence is a post per border cell (one
  MultiMesh) with two rails per side.
- Checked: `test_farm: OK (0 failed)` (new: every building surface is drawn, opaque, and
  the repeating ones are 16 x 16); headless `--quit-after 300` printed no errors or
  warnings; Movie Maker frames with `--demo`: one at the start (house, door, windows, roof,
  chimney, fence) and one after a temporary script walked the farmer right for 40 frames
  (bin, stand with awning and sacks, fence); the script was deleted afterwards.
- Left / next: the house back and west faces are never seen, so they have no windows.

## 2026-10-31 — Farmer in three-quarter views, target brackets
Agent: Claude Code (claude-opus-5-5) · Commit: this commit
- Done: after playing, the user found the walk odd (only a flat front and back, no side)
  and the white cell highlight not under the farmer. Measured with
  `Camera3D.unproject_position` while walking: Right goes to the lower right of the screen,
  Down lower left, Left upper left, Up upper right, so every direction is a screen diagonal.
  The farmer is now drawn three-quarters: the front view turned to the lower left, the back
  view to the upper left (mirrored for Right / Up as before). Steps go sideways on screen:
  contact frames spread the legs with the opposite arm forward, pass frames lift one foot.
  The highlight is the tool's target (the cell in front), by design; it is now corner
  brackets instead of a filled square so it reads as a target, with a comment saying so.
- Checked: `test_farm: OK (0 failed)`; headless `--quit-after 300` printed no errors or
  warnings; a temporary SceneTree script pressed each direction (walk, then run) under Movie
  Maker, and the frames show the farmer facing the way they move in all 8 cases, with the
  brackets on the cell in front. The script was deleted afterwards.
- Left / next: no tool-swing animation yet (milestone 3).

## 2026-10-31 — Ground tiles
Agent: Claude Code (claude-opus-5-5) · Commit: this commit
- Done: PlaceholderArt draws 16 x 16 ground tiles: grass and path in 4 variants each (picked
  from the cell position so the field is not stamped), tilled soil with furrows (dark trench,
  lit ridge every 4 rows), wet soil much darker with a glint, pond water with ripples and a
  bank + foam line on each side that touches land (`ground:water:<mask>`). `ground_key()`
  picks the tile per cell (buildings stand on path, the fence on grass). FarmView draws these
  tiles, so the 3D ground texture and the 2D view both use them; the flat colours are gone
  except the 2D building / fence markers.
- Checked: `test_farm: OK (0 failed)` (new: tilled / wet / grass keys follow the cell, wet
  tile mean luminance at least 0.12 below dry, pond corner / middle masks, tiles fully
  opaque 16 x 16); headless `--quit-after 300` printed no errors or warnings; Movie Maker
  frames: 3D `--demo` shows wet and dry columns clearly apart and furrows visible; 2D shows
  grass variety, path under buildings and the pond with banks.
- Left / next: the pond is not in the 3D demo frame (camera starts by the house), so its
  banks were seen in the 2D view only.

## 2026-10-31 — Crop and field-object placeholders
Agent: Claude Code (claude-opus-5-5) · Commit: this commit
- Done: rock / branch / weed / stump and every crop are drawn in the farmer's style: 2-3
  shades, then an automatic 1 px dark outline around the silhouette. Each crop has a `look`
  in `data/crops.json` (shape root / bush / vine / stalk / ground, leaf and fruit colours,
  extras like leaf style, bulb size, fruit shape, flower). Seed and sprout are shared (sprout
  in the crop's leaf colour); young, grown and ripe follow the shape. Vines and corn are
  16 x 24 with a stake / tall stalk. Keys are now `crop:<id>:<growth>:<ripe|growing>`;
  `PlaceholderArt.cell_key()` replaces FarmWorld's own key function and the 2D view draws the
  same sprites instead of circles. Cucumber leaves were lightened after the first sheet so the
  dark fruit shows.
- Checked: `test_farm: OK (0 failed)` (new: every crop has a look, all 45 crop sprites are
  16 wide and stand on their bottom row, the 9 ripe sprites all differ, cell keys for seed /
  ripe / obstacle); headless `--quit-after 300` printed no errors or warnings; a 4x sheet of
  all crops x growth looks + obstacles; Movie Maker frames of the 3D and 2D views with `--demo`.
- Left / next: the demo field shows no ripe crop (stages 1-3 of turnip / potato / cucumber);
  ripe looks were checked on the sheet only. Seasons other than spring not seen in game.

## 2026-10-31 — Farmer placeholder frames and walk / run animation
Agent: Claude Code (claude-opus-5-5) · Commit: this commit
- Done: the user chose to refine placeholders before real art. Scale check first: in a demo
  frame one sprite pixel is ~2 x 2 screen pixels (shirt 8 px tall -> 16 px on screen), so the
  16 x 24 size stays and 1 px details (outline, eyes) read. PlaceholderArt draws the farmer
  from a pixel map (head / torso, front and back) plus legs, hands and bag placed per frame,
  with a dark outline. Keys `player:<front|back>:<idle|walk|run>:<frame>`; idle 1 frame, walk
  and run 4 (contact, left step, contact, right step; body drops 1 px on contact; run lifts
  feet higher, spreads legs and swings hands more). New `FarmerAnim` picks the key: walk 8 fps
  (two steps per 0.5 s, ~1 cell per step at 60 px/s), run 12 fps; a new pose starts on a step
  frame so a key press shows at once. Player now exposes `moving` / `running`.
- Checked: `test_farm: OK (0 failed)` (8 new animation / frame checks); headless
  `--quit-after 300` printed no errors or warnings; a 6x frame sheet of all 18 frames looked
  right after two fixes (hands needed an outline and to sit against the body); demo Movie
  Maker frame shows the new farmer idle by the house.
- Left / next: walking was not seen in a movie frame (needs key presses); it was checked on
  the frame sheet and in the tests only. No real-key play yet.

## 2026-10-31 — Handoff docs
Agent: Claude Code (claude-opus-5-5) · Commit: this commit
- Done: AGENTS.md (rules incl. clean room, how to run / test / screenshot, code layout, what
  to do after each change), CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP.md (10 milestones, Next up), this log.
- Checked: docs only. Commands in AGENTS.md are the ones used in the entries below.
- Left / next: ROADMAP → Next up (farmer sprites).

## 2026-10-31 — 3D view with Back to Nature's field camera
Agent: Claude Code (claude-opus-5-5) · Commit: 5a5eadd
- Done: the main scene is 3D (`main_3d.gd`, `world3d/farm_world.gd`). Camera: yaw 45°, pitch
  26.6°, eye 25.2 cells from the player, vertical FOV 13.69°. These are taken from the RE
  project's NOTES.md (GTE R / H = 1000 / TR depth 10087 from the ePSXe save state; 400 PS1
  units = 1 cell). Movement stays on the field axes in 4 facings, as measured there (Up walks
  diagonally away). Ground = FarmView (ground only) in a SubViewport texture. Rocks, branches,
  weeds, stumps, crops and the farmer are billboard Sprite3Ds from PlaceholderArt. The farmer
  uses the front image for Down / Right and the back image for Up / Left, with Right / Up
  mirrored. House / bin / stand / fence are boxes. Day / night = a multiply ColorRect under
  the HUD. Shared action code moved to `farm_actions.gd`. The 2D view is kept as
  `scenes/main_2d.tscn`. `-- --demo` starts at 10:00 with planted plots.
- Checked: `test_farm: OK (0 failed)`; Movie Maker frames with and without `--demo` show the
  diamond field, sprites and wet / dry soil with no errors. Sky pixel at 6:01 (102, 144, 200)
  vs computed (102, 143, 200).
- Left / next: not played with real key presses yet. Camera clamp margins (4, 3) are a
  guess. The 3D view rebuilds every object sprite on any cell change (fine at 640 cells).

## 2026-10-31 — v0: core farming loop and design doc
Agent: Claude Code (claude-opus-5-5) · Commit: 50a8a8b
- Done: Godot 4.7 project. Game autoload (clock 0.5 s / minute, day at 6:00, 4 x 30 days,
  weather a day ahead from `data/weather.json`, money, bag, stamina, sleep / pass out at 2:00,
  payout at 18:00). FarmGrid 32 x 20 (till, water, 3 x 3 sowing, growth on watered nights,
  regrowth, out-of-season withering, weeds 1 %, storm loss 1/16, obstacles with tool + hit
  counts). Crops in `data/crops.json` (9 crops, our own numbers). Player (8-way move, 4 facings,
  tile collision), HUD, seed stand, pond refills the can. docs/DESIGN.md = copy of the online
  design doc (rev 8).
- Checked: `tests/test_farm.gd` → `test_farm: OK (0 failed)` (16 checks); a headless run of
  300 frames gave no errors; a Movie Maker frame showed the farm, buildings, player and HUD.
- Left / next: balance numbers are first guesses; no save / load; placeholder drawing only.
