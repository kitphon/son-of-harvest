## 2026-10-31 — Handoff docs
Agent: Claude Code (claude-opus-5-5) · Commit: this commit
- Done: AGENTS.md (rules incl. clean room, how to run / test / screenshot, code layout, what
  to do after each change), CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP.md (10 milestones, Next up), this log.
- Checked: docs only. Commands in AGENTS.md are the ones used in the entries below.
- Left / next: ROADMAP → Next up (farmer sprites).

## 2026-10-31 — 3D view with Back to Nature's field camera
Agent: Claude Code (claude-opus-5-5) · Commit: 5a5eadd
- Done: the main scene is 3D (`main_3d.gd`, `world3d/farm_world.gd`). Camera: yaw 45°, pitch
  26.6°, eye 25.2 cells from the player, vertical FOV 13.69°. These are taken from the RE
  project's NOTES.md (GTE R / H = 1000 / TR depth 10087 from the ePSXe save state; 400 PS1
  units = 1 cell). Movement stays on the field axes in 4 facings, as measured there (Up walks
  diagonally away). Ground = FarmView (ground only) in a SubViewport texture. Rocks, branches,
  weeds, stumps, crops and the farmer are billboard Sprite3Ds from PlaceholderArt. The farmer
  uses the front image for Down / Right and the back image for Up / Left, with Right / Up
  mirrored. House / bin / stand / fence are boxes. Day / night = a multiply ColorRect under
  the HUD. Shared action code moved to `farm_actions.gd`. The 2D view is kept as
  `scenes/main_2d.tscn`. `-- --demo` starts at 10:00 with planted plots.
- Checked: `test_farm: OK (0 failed)`; Movie Maker frames with and without `--demo` show the
  diamond field, sprites and wet / dry soil with no errors. Sky pixel at 6:01 (102, 144, 200)
  vs computed (102, 143, 200).
- Left / next: not played with real key presses yet. Camera clamp margins (4, 3) are a
  guess. The 3D view rebuilds every object sprite on any cell change (fine at 640 cells).

## 2026-10-31 — v0: core farming loop and design doc
Agent: Claude Code (claude-opus-5-5) · Commit: 50a8a8b
- Done: Godot 4.7 project. Game autoload (clock 0.5 s / minute, day at 6:00, 4 x 30 days,
  weather a day ahead from `data/weather.json`, money, bag, stamina, sleep / pass out at 2:00,
  payout at 18:00). FarmGrid 32 x 20 (till, water, 3 x 3 sowing, growth on watered nights,
  regrowth, out-of-season withering, weeds 1 %, storm loss 1/16, obstacles with tool + hit
  counts). Crops in `data/crops.json` (9 crops, our own numbers). Player (8-way move, 4 facings,
  tile collision), HUD, seed stand, pond refills the can. docs/DESIGN.md = copy of the online
  design doc (rev 8).
- Checked: `tests/test_farm.gd` → `test_farm: OK (0 failed)` (16 checks); a headless run of
  300 frames gave no errors; a Movie Maker frame showed the farm, buildings, player and HUD.
- Left / next: balance numbers are first guesses; no save / load; placeholder drawing only.
